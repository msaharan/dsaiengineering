# MinerU Learning Path

Welcome to your comprehensive guide to learning **MinerU** - a powerful open-source tool for extracting high-quality structured content from complex PDFs.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This learning path takes you from zero to productive with MinerU in five progressive levels:

1. **Overview & Motivation** - Understand what MinerU is and why it exists
2. **Installation & Hello World** - Get it running and parse your first PDF
3. **Core Concepts** - Master the fundamental ideas behind MinerU
4. **Practical Patterns** - Build real-world document processing pipelines
5. **Next Steps** - Explore advanced topics and community resources

## 📚 How to Use This Guide

### Read in Order
The content is structured progressively. Each level builds on the previous one, so we recommend following them sequentially.

### Hands-On Practice
Each level includes runnable code examples in the `code-examples/` folder. Try them out as you learn.

### Time Estimate
- **Quick start**: 30 minutes (Levels 1-2)
- **Comprehensive**: 2-3 hours (All levels)
- **Mastery**: Ongoing practice with real documents
