# Skills vs Tools, MCP, and Subagents

## Summary of the Slides

### Skills vs MCP

| Feature | MCP | Skills |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **Purpose** | Connects your agent to external systems and data (databases, APIs, services) | Teaches your agent what to do with that data |

| **Context** | Tool definitions (name, description, parameters) always live in the context window | Skills are loaded dynamically as needed |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed set of capabilities | Skills can include scripts as tools that are used when needed ("tools on demand") |



### Skills vs Subagents

| Feature | Subagents | Skills |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Have their own isolated context and tool permissions | Provide expertise knowledge to the main agent or any of its subagents |
| **Operation** | Agent delegates a task to the specialized subagent, which works independently (and maybe in parallel) and returns results | Skills inform how work should be done |
