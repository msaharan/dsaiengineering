# Prompts with Skils

## Part 1

I'm attaching my weekly marketing campaign data. Analyze the data to help me understand how each channel is doing (funnel and efficiency performance) and if I need to reallocate my budget. I can shift up to $10k between channels, and limit increases to 15% per channel.

Present the results directly in the chat.

## Part 2

Create an Excel report with: 
* Executive Summary sheet with key findings and a budget reallocation table 
* Funnel Analysis sheet 
* Efficiency Analysis sheet
* Raw Data sheet

Use color coding: green for good, red for bad. 


**Note**: During filming, the excel sheet we obtained did not include formulas or references between sheets. If you want the excel sheets to include formulas instead of just values, you can add this line to the prompt of Part 2: 

- Make sure to include the formulas and references in the excel sheets.

Since the preview in Claude.ai only shows a simplified view of the spreadsheet, it might not render all the Excel formatting, formulas, or multiple sheets.
