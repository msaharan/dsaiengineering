# Progressive Learning Framework

Structure for teaching tools in digestible levels.

## The Five Levels

### Level 1: Overview & Motivation

**Goal**: Understand WHAT and WHY

Cover:

- What problem does this tool solve?
- What existed before? Why is this better?
- Who uses it? For what?
- When should you NOT use it?

### Level 2: Installation & Hello World

**Goal**: Get it running locally

Cover:

- Prerequisites
- Installation steps
- Minimal working example
- Run it, see output
- Verify it works

### Level 3: Core Concepts

**Goal**: Understand the mental model

Cover:

- 3-5 fundamental concepts
- How they relate to each other
- One example per concept
- Common mistakes for each

### Level 4: Practical Patterns

**Goal**: Build something real

- Cover most common use cases
- Provide code examples to get started, showing them progressively starting with a simple example and adding more details. For example, if the tool is an agent SDK:
  - first show how to build a very simple agent
  - then show how to connect tools
  - then show how to create a workflow with subagents  

### Level 5: Next Steps

**Goal**: Know where to go deeper

Cover:

- Advanced topics to explore
- Best resources for each
- Community resources
- How to get help
- Propose a mini-project or hands-on exercises

## Code Example Principles

- Every example must be complete and runnable
- Start minimal, add complexity incrementally
- Show expected output
- Include comments for non-obvious parts
- Show common mistakes and fixes
